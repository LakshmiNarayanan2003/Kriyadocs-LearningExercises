# KriyaDocs : MicroApp

The MicroApp that I've choosen is:

## Write a command line chatbot that accepts a word and finds its meaning, synonyms and three sentences where the word can be used.

And since the 4th statement is just a UI add-on to the above MicroApp,
I've also done the 4th, i.e.,

## Write a word bot (same as 2) with a simple html/css/js interface.
